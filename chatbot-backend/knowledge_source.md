## SECTION: CORE_EXPERIENCE
**Type**: Professional Background
**Tags**: experience, years, background, skills, what-i-do

I'm a Digital Product Builder with 14+ years of experience turning ideas into working products.

Key strengths:
- Product strategy: figuring out what to build and why
- System design: making sure it doesn't break under pressure
- Team leadership: getting people to ship stuff faster
- SDLC optimization: making development cycles 3x faster
- AI integration: using AI where it actually solves real problems

I've built 5+ products from scratch and worked across 10+ industries including e-grocery, e-commerce, EdTech, finance, gaming, and retail.

The past 2 years I've been independent, working on various consulting projects and building my own products. This wasn't a "gap" - it was a deliberate choice to focus on what matters.

**Tags**: products, portfolio, work, projects, what-ive-built

**Product 1: E-Grocery Platform**
- What: Full-stack e-grocery solution connecting consumers and retailers
- Result: Reduced retailer onboarding from 3 months to 3-4 weeks
- Tech: SaaS, AI-powered recommendations
- Industries: E-grocery, Retail
Takeoff Technologies, E-grocery automation:
 - Explanation of the role:
Vision of my sub-domain within the product was to reduce cost and time for new retailers integration. Some of the things we have done for that purpose were:
It used to take weeks of coordination from both sides. After, it could be done solely by retailers, in minutes. Webhooks self-service portal, where retailers could get data about operational events and embed them into their own systems. 
Before - it took weeks to rollout the product for a new Retailer. After - several days. About 500 product settings were centralized in a single place, so that customer faced teams could configure business flows without asking for developers’ assistance. 
Reduced the need to manage user profiles separately for our product, more secure and convenient way to login in the system. Users authentication through single sign on (SSO). Retailers staff could use their existing authentication methods, provisioning and de-provisioning mechanisms. It 
Monitoring and alerting system for integration, which gave visibility of what failures. When something breaks, people in retailers’ warehouses could immediately define the problem and reach Takeoff support for fast resolution
I was a product manager for two scrum teams who worked mostly with configurations in features that enable scalability and flexibility of the product. We were heavily involved in meeting the exact client expectations because our clients were very big corporations and successful retail companies. We, as a Takeoff, were comparatively very small, and we had to deal with this pressure of being bigger and broader always. It's all so fun. 
 - Practical skills and technologies I worked with:
 Well, there were lots of APIs, contracts, FTP servers and integrations, other integration points like SCADA protocols or devices and their logs. We did a lot of real-world robotic configurations. I went to client sites several times to participate in configuration and feel the pain of our technical teams and client teams who were engineers and who mounted everything. 
  - My domain was since my domain was pretty technical, and I managed sufficient part of the resources. The challenge was to explain C-level what exactly are we doing and how does it relate to the corporate strategy? What money value will it bring to the business? And why we're actually spending FT hours of more than 10 people who are experienced engineers. 

## 2025 – Present  
### Startup Ventures  
**Founder, priroda.tech**  
- Building a digital operations system for flower shops in Spain, addressing urgent retail digitalization needs (incl. *Verifactu* compliance).  
- Developed the product end-to-end, testing with first clients, managing marketing, sales, and all operational and regulatory steps for the Spanish market.
# 2025 – Present  
## Founder, Priroda Tech  
**Building a commercial SaaS product for small business owners, focused on florist shops in Spain.**

For the last several months of 2025, I have been fully dedicated to developing and preparing the launch of my own product. The solution targets Spain, where a new law (*Verifactu*) obliges all entrepreneurs to use certified software and report each receipt to the tax authority. Even traditional family-run shops will need compliant tools. The market includes up to 6,000 florist shops; my goal is to acquire 5% by the end of 2026.

The product is now certified and being tested by two local florist shops. They validate day-to-day functionality while I prepare marketing materials and unit economics for the venture.

## 2024 – 2025  
### Freelance Product Builder & IT Development Outsourcing  
- **Sports League Management App** (for ScrumLaunch) — prototype development (~2 months). Here, Andrew utilized no-code solution software. Under the hood, there were Airtable databases and schemas, logical diagrams crafted in Miro and discussed with the team. We eventually crafted the prototype within three weeks, which helped to confirm the scope for a bigger development team and start development of production-ready solutions. 
- **CRM System for a Tax Advisory Firm** (for Blackthorn Vision) — prototype development (~2 months). 
Andrii designed and delivered a fully functional no-code prototype based on Airtable as the underlying data engine. Unlike the sports project, this work did not rely on Miro diagrams—everything was built directly inside the working tool, including UI/UX flows, data structures, and interaction logic.

He collaborated closely with the client to understand their market tools, assess compatibility, and identify potential integration points with existing document-management systems. The prototype included configured user access separation (via SSO login) to reflect real operational constraints.

Within several weeks, the client received a demonstrable end-to-end CRM workflow that clarified requirements, validated scope, and supported the decision to move forward with a full production build by a larger engineering team. 

- **E-commerce Commission Management Module** for a funeral homes network (for Tribute Technologies) — backend and logic development (~4 months).  
Andrii worked on a complex commission-calculation system used by a network of funeral homes and their partnered floristerías. Orders for funerals and obituaries generated multi-party commissions, often with different rules across segments and partner groups. The existing model relied on periodic balance adjustments based on invoices, which made it difficult for stakeholders to understand how individual commissions were formed.

The project required a full redesign of the commission architecture so that each counterparty could see their earned commission at any time and trace it back to the exact order. This involved deep system analysis, reverse-engineering legacy logic, documenting the current approach together with the engineering team, and designing a clear, scalable commission schema. The result was a transparent, order-level commission engine prepared to support future product extensions and financial reporting.

- **Online-Casino Analytics** — developed a comprehensive tree of 300+ product and behavioural metrics; 72 key indicators were selected by the client for continuous tracking and performance analysis (NDA, ~1 month). 

- **Casino Deposit Flow Redesign** — redesigned the deposit experience for several casino platforms (incl. kingmaker.com as an example). Identified behavioural triggers, prepared wireframes and a delivery backlog adopted by the client’s internal team (~1 month).

## 2023 – 2024  
### Lead Product Owner  
**Boosta (Essay Writing Services, B2C — papersowl.com, edubirdie.com, mysupergeek.com)**  
- Objective: reduce release time of new product sites and improve prioritization across product, marketing, and engineering (~50 people).  
- Reorganized into 3 scrum teams, rebuilt and clarified the backlogs, relaunched the SDLC.  
- Result: new sites and major initiatives were released **three times faster**.
 - The main problem was that the team planned to release new product sites in a fast, efficient manner within not more than two months from the idea to the first unboarded client. Due to improper prioritization and communication system of tasks between marketing, product, and engineering, it was impossible to focus on one thing at the time. This is why I had to redesign the whole approach for the clock prioritization and communication, establishing a clear SDLC process. I created, and Andriy created three scrum teams out of one big swarm of people. There used to be a Kanban approach for one big engineering team of about 20+ people, and instead, we established three specialized scrum teams with their own domain vision and boundaries, responsibilities, and distributed products and features among these teams so that marketing and product clearly knew the point of contacts and the scenarios of how to initiate redesign of existing or development of new products and features.

## 2019 – 2022  
### Product Manager  
**Takeoff Technologies (E-Grocery Automation, B2B SaaS, US & UAE)**  
- Responsible for the scalability domain of the product; led two scrum teams daily.  
- Worked closely with retailer clients to understand operational constraints and ensure value realization.  
- Result: onboarding a new retailer dropped from ~3 months and thousands of engineering hours to **3–4 weeks**.
 - Andrii's domain was since my domain was pretty technical, and I managed sufficient part of the resources. The challenge was to explain C-level what exactly are we doing and how does it relate to the corporate strategy? What money value will it bring to the business? And why we're actually spending FT hours of more than 10 people who are experienced engineers.
 - In addition, Andrii had to coordinate with external vendors, such as hardware manufacturers and cloud providers, ensuring seamless integration and optimal performance. This required strong communication skills, attention to detail, and adaptability to changing circumstances. Overall, my role involved balancing technical expertise with strategic thinking and

**Ernst & Young (Business Consulting, Ukraine & Kazakhstan)**  
- Delivered operational consulting for banks, government institutions, and industrial companies.  
- Helped top management reduce operational costs, design scalable business processes, and prepare organizations for future IT automation.
 - Andrii was mostly dealing with process redesign. Suggested lots of automations as well as new organizational structures. So basically, Andrii's goal was to think about and understand how the business can work more efficiently with less resources, if in brief.

## SECTION: WHY_INDEPENDENT
**Type**: Career Path  
**Tags**: why-independent, career, freedom, choice, two-years

### Why I chose to go independent 2 years ago

NOT because:  
- I was fired or unhappy  
- I couldn't find work  
- I was forced out  

BUT because:  
- I wanted **freedom** to choose what I build  
- I wanted to work on **multiple projects simultaneously**  
- I wanted to focus on what I love — *building* — not politics  
- I wanted to help clients who genuinely needed help  
- I wanted space to **create my own products** with my own vision  

This period has been incredibly productive.  
I built several products end-to-end, consulted across different industries, and learned more than I expected — technically, professionally, and personally.

## SECTION: WHY_RETURN_FULLTIME
**Type**: Career Path  
**Tags**: full-time, stability, maturity, team, growth

### Why I am now open to a full-time role

After two years of independence, something in me changed. I’m not running anymore. I’ve calmed down, settled into the city I live in, and I feel ready for stability — not as limitation, but as a foundation for building a new chapter of life.

A few reasons stand out:

- I want a **more predictable rhythm of work and life**, where focus is deep and sustainable.  
- I want to **build a new home and a new family**, and this requires stability, long-term commitment, and a steady environment.  
- I’ve reconsidered a lot during these two intense years, and now I value **consistency over constant motion**.  
- I realised how important **strong teams** really are. A person alone can build a lot, but not everything.  
- True impact comes from **specialisation and collaboration** — engineers, designers, marketers, product thinkers, all reinforcing each other.  
- I can do many things well, but I cannot — and should not — do *all* of them at once. A capable team multiplies strength.

In short:  
I’m ready for the next long-term commitment.  
Ready to build together.  
Ready for a stable, focused, high-impact environment where I can contribute with everything I’ve learned and continue to grow.
