## Product Overview

It was the development of a comprehensive ERP solution for one of the largest Ukrainian agricultural companies — Kernel.

The client requested a custom system for managing their crop fields and machinery operations. The system connected all agricultural activities into one ecosystem where planning, resources, and field execution work together. It determines what to grow on each field based on soil, weather, and rotation rules, and calculates how much seed, fertilizer, chemicals, and machinery time the farm will need for the season. It then builds a clear schedule of fieldwork and helps workers follow it through mobile apps.

**Scale:**
- **> 6,000 crop fields**
- **> 12,000 heavy machinery items**
- **> 50,000 field operations to be planned annually**, each costing from $100 to $10,000

The client needed automated risk planning and the ability to replan and adjust technical workflows if conditions changed — such as crop disease, price fluctuations, or deviations from equipment usage plans. The platform monitors fields, crops, and machinery in real time, detects risks early, and integrates with external tools and company systems.

## Objective

My main goal was to design the logic of the solution, data model, algorithms of operations planning. I had 4 scrum teams with 1 BA inside each team and had to coordinate business analysis stream, as well as be a single point of contact with the client stakeholders.

## What Was Done

The system was delivered to the client, with dozens of UATs, training, and re-works completed.

The client not only rolled out the system for its own operations, but established a white label solution for similar big agricultural corporations in Australia.
