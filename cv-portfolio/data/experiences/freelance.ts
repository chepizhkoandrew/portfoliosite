## Overview

During 2024-2025, I worked as a freelance product builder taking on multiple projects from concept to prototype/MVP. This period was focused on rapid learning across industries and validating my ability to deliver complete products quickly.

I delivered 5 distinct products across different verticals: sports management, tax advisory, e-commerce, casino analytics, and gaming. Each project required rapid requirement gathering, user-centered design, and agile delivery.
