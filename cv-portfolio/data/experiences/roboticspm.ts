## Product Overview

This system was a combined software-and-hardware solution used by grocery retailers to speed up how online food orders were prepared.

When customers placed an order, items were collected in micro-fulfillment centers within minutes, supported by robotic tools that helped workers prepare packages quickly and send them to delivery without delay.

## Objective

The main objective within this domain was to shorten and simplify the onboarding of new grocery retailers.

The goal was to reduce both the time and the cost of integration, and to minimize reliance on development teams for routine configuration tasks.

## Key Results

- Rollout time reduced from weeks to days. Around 500 product settings were reorganized and centralized in one structured place. Customer-facing teams gained the ability to configure operational flows independently, without developer involvement.

- Simplified and more secure login process. Retailer staff were able to access the system using their existing company login methods (SSO). User access was automatically granted and revoked, reducing manual work and improving security.

- Faster detection and resolution of operational issues. Monitoring tools were introduced to show exactly where and why problems occurred inside the warehouses. Frontline workers could resolve simple issues immediately or share precise diagnostic information with support teams, significantly reducing the time needed to restore normal operations.
