## Product Overview

The site's portfolio was about EdTech - tutoring platform and ghost-writing services. Our target audience was Students from Tier 1 countries.

The product portfolio contained about 20 products of different sizes and maturities. All of them were connected under one backend and operational umbrella.

A team of approximately 50 people operated across several overlapping structures:
- functional roles
- product-based groups
- and the existing departmental hierarchy

Because these layers were not fully aligned, responsibilities often intersected, and coordination required additional clarity.

## Objective

My main goal was to reduce cycle time of new products and major features release. Ensure that the team has focus priorities and doesn't parallel 100,500 never-finishing tasks.

I had to:
- Come up with a prioritization system
- Revise and clean up the backlog
- Re-organize the team of product managers and engineers so that they could focus on one task at a time, and everybody has a sense of scope boundaries

## What Was Done

**Team and Processes Restructuring:**
- Formed and stormed three scrum teams with engineers and 1 Product Owner each. Agreed on their scope boundaries, so that anyone knows what every team is responsible for and where exactly should one go with a particular request.
- More than a thousand Jira backlog tickets closed, or reorganized in a clean structure of epics

**Product-Related Achievements:**
- Released new flow for papersowl.com, improving ECR metrics—strong performance for a mature product
- Scaled up reference program from test sites to all portfolio, generating additional revenue
- Released new product (step2a.com), early stage with structured foundation
- Established structured test plan templates in order not to waste traffic for controversial hypotheses
