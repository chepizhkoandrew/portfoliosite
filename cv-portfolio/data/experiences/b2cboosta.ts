## Challenge
Boosta operates 3 distinct product brands (PapersOwl, EduBirdie, MySuperGeek) with a shared development team of ~50 engineers. The organization faced:
- Unclear task prioritization
- Slow release cycles
- Multiple competing backlogs
- Team confusion about product strategy
- Inefficient SDLC processes

## Solution Implemented
Redesigned the entire Software Development Life Cycle:
1. **Unified Roadmap** - Created single source of truth for priorities across 3 brands
2. **Team Organization** - Organized 3 scrum teams with clear ownership
3. **Process Optimization** - Streamlined sprints, planning, and release cycles
4. **Backlog Clearing** - Systematically cleared and re-prioritized existing work
5. **Metrics** - Established KPIs to track velocity and release frequency

## Results
- **3x faster releases** - New product sites launched significantly faster
- **Improved clarity** - Teams knew what to build and why
- **Better flow** - Reduced wait times between development and deployment
- **Enhanced morale** - Clear priorities and faster feedback loops

## Key Learnings
- Importance of clear organizational structure at scale
- How SDLC process directly impacts team velocity
- Value of unified roadmap across multiple product lines
- Communication is as important as process in scaling teams
